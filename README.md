    leftArm  
    rightArm  
- Added additional TJBot API (and supporting functions):  
    tj.waveArms()  
    tj.leftArmBack()  
    tj.rightArmBack()  
    tj.raiseRightArm()  
    tj.raiseLeftArm()  
    tj.lowerLeftArm()  
    tj.lowerRightArm()  
* Rewired TJBot servo motor to PIN 24 (BCM 8 )– Left Arm  
* Wired a second servo motor to PIN 22 (BCM 25) – Right Arm  
PS: Also inserted @waugh code to support multiple LEDs.  
PPSS: I'm collected a presentation about TJBot and this task is  born to support activities performed at I.I.S. Galileo Galilei di Crema (CR), a secondary state school with about 1,900 students aged 14-19 working in two fields of education: “Applied Sciences high school” and “Technological high school”.
